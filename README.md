# Revolut

Application Test for Revolut

The solution implements an MvvM architecture created from scratch to satisfy the requirements for this test.

The MvvM app uses a layer of Services to perform the Network request, with RxKotlin

This branch has been develop without recycler view, only with linear layouts, and the performance is as expected

We have use the Reflection to extract all the currencies from the Revolut Api Response, and reflections methods to fetch the
required values.

Thanks for the time reading!
